* Q1
Robinson Crusoe cannot beget coconuts; the only solution satisfying the boundary
condition $K_{t=0}=0$ is the boring, and, for Mr. Crusoe, unfortunate
\[ K(t) = 0 \ \forall t\geq0 \]
* Q2 Model
** Optimization problem
The capital stock $K$ of coconuts is subject to the control variable $c=c(t)$,
consumption by Robinson at any given time. Robinson is impatient and
continuously disconts the utility of his future consumption at rate $\rho>0$.
The utility does not explicitly depend on the current state $K$: $u = u(c)$, in particular
$u_K = 0$

The goal is to maximize the total lifetime discounted utility, by choosing a consumption path $c(t)$:
\begin{equation} \max_{c(t)} \int_{t=0}^\infty\,e^{-\rho t}\,u(c)\,dt \end{equation}

The capital accumulation is constrained by its natural increment
and the contol input; a coconut eaten is coconut not planted:
\begin{equation} \dot{K} \leq f(K) - c \end{equation}

** Current-Value Hamiltionian
\begin{equation} H = u(c) + m \cdot (f - c) \end{equation}

Where the autonomous behavior of $K$ is given[fn::this is in contrast to e.g. Solow model, where the natural tendency of capital is always to depreciate]
by $\dot{K}=f(K), sign(f'(K)) = sign (\kappa-K)$ for some environment capacity $\kappa>0$, and $f$ is everywhere concave: $f''<0$. In particular, $f_c = 0$.

* Q3 Pontryagin conditions
- Intratemporal Allocation. The shadow price of a consumed coconut is its marginal utility:
  \begin{equation} H_c = u_c + m \cdot (f - c)_c = 0 = c_u - m \end{equation}
- Intertemporal Optimality. decay rate of the shadow price is the combination of discount factor and capital accumulation:
  \begin{equation} H_K = u_K + m \cdot (f' - 0) = m f' = \rho m - \dot{m} \end{equation}
  which we recognize as a separable ODE:

#+NAME: mdot
  \begin{equation}\frac{\dot{m}}{m} = \rho-f' \end{equation}

- Resource Constraint. Tomorrow's coconut grow from today's unconsumed ones

#+NAME: Kdot
  \begin{equation} H_m = f - c = \dot{K} \end{equation}

- No Bequests:
  \begin{equation} \lim_{t\to\infty} m(t)\, u(t)\, e^{-\rho t} = 0 \end{equation}

* Q4 Phase Portrait
Equations 7 \ref{Kdot} and 6 \ref{mdot} together yield the phase plane equation
\[\frac{dK}{dm} = \frac{f-c}{m(\rho-f')}\]

Note that the $m$ -isocline is given by $\rho = f'$, which, given that $f''<0$
has at most one solution[fn::by the mean value theorem] for $f'$ and therefore for $K$.
Assume this exists and denote it by $K^*$. Note that clearly $0<K^*<\kappa$.

For $K$ -isocline, we recall that the usual requirements on $u(c)$ is declining
marginal utility, so we intuitively[fn::if we take $u=\ln(c)$, this would be
exact] treat $m$ as inverse of $c$.
An isocline has to asymtotically approach $K=0$ and $K=\kappa$ since the value of $f$ approaches
zero there[fn::for a concrete example, consider logistic equation $f=K(A-K)$], and attains a
minimum corresponding to $f'=0$.

We see from the sketch of the phase diagram that there is a *unique steady
state* at $(K*<\kappa, m^*)$. For any state with $K>\kappa$, the natural tendency is
for $K$ to decrease, and Robinson can only exacerbate this since $c\geq0$.

We also notice that this steady state is a *saddle point*;
small distirbance in the direction of decreasing $m$ (i.e. increating $c$) while
decreasing $K$ will evolve towards $m,K\to0$. The arm starting from a small
deviation of increased $K$ and decreased $c$ will evolve towards $m\to\infty, K\to\kappa$.
